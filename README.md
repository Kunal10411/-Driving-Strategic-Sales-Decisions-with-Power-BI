## **Project Overview**

I'm pleased to share a recent project where I developed an advanced Power BI dashboard for a leading computer hardware company. This tool significantly enhanced their sales tracking capabilities, converting complex Excel reports into clear, actionable insights. The dashboard provides real-time visibility into revenue trends and regional performance, empowering leadership to make data-driven decisions that drive growth.
